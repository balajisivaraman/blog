**[Geek Night Coimbatore - 18th
Edition](https://twcbe.github.io/geeknight/mar2018.html)**: The first
version of the talk delivered in the Chennai geek night. The
difference between this version and the Chennai version is that this
features introductory material on Rust Lifetimes. I decided to cut
this in the later version and instead talk about some general features
of the Rust language.
