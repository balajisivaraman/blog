**[Chennai Ruby Meetup - March
2018](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/chennai-ruby/events/248501871/)**:
The goal of this talk was to gently introduce Rust to Ruby developers.
It begins with a few slides on the pros and cons of Ruby. It then
moves on to features in Rust that will entice Ruby programmers,
primarily talking about OO and TDD in Rust. It finally ends with an
introduction to Ownership and Borrowing, two of Rust's key language
features.
