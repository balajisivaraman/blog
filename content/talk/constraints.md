**[Geek Night Chennai - 36th
Edition](https://twchennai.github.io/geeknight/)**: The goal of this
talk was to primarily highlight how the constraints imposed by
statically typed languages can liberating to our mind. It starts with
a very simply function written in JavaScript (a dynamically typed
language) and demonstrates the challenges in inferring what the
function does. It then slowly adds one constraint after another to
this simple function and talks about how each of them helps improve
our understanding of what the function does.
