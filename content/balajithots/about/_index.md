My name is Balaji Sivaraman, and I'm a software enginner working in
[ThoughtWorks
Chennai](https://www.thoughtworks.com/locations/chennai). I'm also a
passionate writer and use this blog primarily as an outlet for my
thoughts on cinema, books, music, sports, TV shows, and videogames.

I also have a technical blog that I maintain at my main site:
[balajisivaraman.com](https://www.balajisivaraman.com).
