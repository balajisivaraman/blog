After a two month layoff due to exams and other stuff, I am finally going to start posting again regularly, hopefully.

I wanted to write on and on (like I did last year) about how Manchester United remained the best team in England by retaining their Barclay’s Premier League title and how they proved that they are almost the best team in the whole of Europe by winning the Champions League title. However, I realized that there are already many articles in the net covering another magnificent season for us and so, decided to only point out some key moments in the season that ultimately led to United’s double delight.

**Vs Tottenham at Old Trafford – 26 Aug, 2007**
After struggling in the first 3 games, Nani’s wonderful goal saved the game for United handing us our first win of the new season.

**Vs Chelsea at Old Trafford – 23 Sep, 2007**
Chelsea’s newly appointed manager, Avram Grant could not do enough to spark the Blues and United ended up winning the match 2-0 with considerable ease providing moral higher ground against title rivals.

**Vs Liverpool at Anfield – 16 Dec, 2007**
A match in which United were expected to slip-up turned out into a brilliant defensive display as we won the match 1-0 thanks to a solitary Tevez goal on 43 minutes.

**Vs Newcastle at Old Trafford – 12 Jan, 2008**
Cristiano Ronaldo’s first hat-trick (after having 11 double-goal performances) for the Red Devils added spice to a wonderful performance by the whole team that saw Newcastle United (who were notably very poor) being humiliated 6-0 in front of a packed Old Trafford crowd. Not a wholly significant game in terms of our chase for the title but still one that added a huge deal to our superior goal difference.

**Vs Arsenal at Old Trafford (FA Cup) – 16 Feb, 2008**
After two poor performances in the 1-1 draw at Spurs and a painful derby defeat to Man City at home on the 50th anniversary of the Munich disaster, United were faced with a difficult 5th round tie against Arsenal. But United’s powerhouse performance not only led to a 4-0 defeat for the Gunners but also proved crucial in wrecking their pole position in the league ultimately paving way for our 17th league title.

**Vs Liverpool at Old Trafford – 23 Mar, 2008**
After Mascherano's determination to get himself sent off ended up with the exact same thing happening, United cruised to a 3-0 victory in what, before half time, looked like a very close game with a good performance by the scousers. The same day Arsenal lost at Chelsea 2-1, which meant Chelsea became United’s primary challengers for the title.

**Vs Roma (Champions League quarterfinals) – 1 and 9 April, 2008**
A clinical performance at the Stadio Olimpico with goals from Rooney and Ronaldo meant that United had a considerably easy progression to the semifinals provided no surprises occurred at home. As it turned out, a penalty miss by De Rossi for Roma (minus star man Totti) and a Tevez header on 70 minutes helped United to a 3-0 aggregate win setting up a semifinal clash with Barcelona.

**Vs Arsenal at Old Trafford – 13 April, 2008**
Arsenal – like much of their performance towards the end of the season – took the lead through Adebayor on 48 minutes but gave up a penalty less than 6 minutes later which Ronaldo duly converted to put United level. A wonderful Hargreaves free-kick on 72 minutes sealed the victory and also meant that United had a great chance of retaining their title.

**Vs Barcelona (Champions League semifinals) – 23 and 29 April, 2008**
When Ronaldo missed the penalty in the 3rd minute which would have destroyed Barca’s morale, I feared the worst and memories of AC Milan a year ago began to creep in. But a wonderful defensive display even without Vidic led to a 0-0 draw at the Nou Camp – the lack of an away goal was still a bugging factor. Ultimately, a wonderful Scholes goal on 14 minutes in the home tie combined with another gritty defensive performance (keeping Messi, Deco and company at bay) led to an 1-0 aggregate win over the Catalans setting up the first all English Champions League final against Chelsea on 21st May at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow.

**Vs Chelsea at Stamford Bridge – 26 April, 2008**
Sandwiched in between those two ties was a fixture where United could have sealed the BPL title (albeit not mathematically). However, two Ballack goals with the second one coming on 84 minutes led to a 2-1 victory for the Blues landing them right on par with United on the points table. However, United’s attacking spirit led to them having a much superior goal difference which meant the destiny of the title was still in our hands.

**Vs West Ham and Wigan – 3 and 11 May, 2008**
United came good in the home game against West Ham winning 4-1 even though only 10 men finished the game. The final day of the season was wonderful since the title was not yet decided. But a Ronaldo penalty and a Giggs goal – on the day he equaled Sir Bobby’s record of 758 appearences – led to United sealing their 17th League title. With Chelsea ending with a 1-1 draw, United also won the title with a gap of 2 points and not on goal difference as had been anticipated.

Another wonderful BPL performance by the Red Devils. But they added to wonderful season by winning the Champions League title also, the final of which I look at in my next post.
