What makes the _Mass Effect_ trilogy one of the greatest game series of all time?

That question will understandably generate a myriad of responses from the series' long-time fans. Some will highlight the breathtaking science-fiction world the creators gave us, vaguely reminiscent of _Star Wars_ and _Star Trek_, yet completely new all the same. Some will point to the abundant gameplay options available to the player; whether playing as a Soldier, Engineer or Biotic, there was always something new to be found in each playthrough. Nearly everybody will point to the consequences the players' decisions have on the game world, with choices made in the first game having serious ramifications in the third while hurtling towards the trilogy's much-maligned conclusion.

Every single one of them is valid, and they all combine to give _Mass Effect_ its deserved critical and commercial recognition. However, to me, _Mass Effect's_ greatness lies in providing me the opportunity to indulge in my own epic science fiction story. For the course of three glorious games and about 200 unforgettable hours, I was Wayne Shepard, savior of the galaxy, destroyer of the Reapers, and protector of humanity.

Before _Mass Effect_ came along in 2007, there had been quite a few games that had me pulled me in through their sheer storytelling prowess. _Knights of the Old Republic_ immediately comes to mind, being another Bioware product. It was the very first role-playing game I played, and it was equally great in telling a story where I, and my decisions, mattered, not to mention having the dignity of being home to the greatest plot-twist in the history of video games. _Planescape Torment_ was another game where the player's choices made a huge difference. It was also way ahead of its time as far as storytelling was concerned. _Half Life_ is probably the single most influential game in terms of moving videogames as an immersive medium forward. However, all those games came with caveats. _KOTOR_ was primarily not an original IP. Though the story was completely original, the races and politics wasn't. It was also riddled with numerous bugs which made a lot of sequences practically unplayable, constantly taking the player out of the experience. It also sported a simpler dialogue system where the player could easily gauge how their responses would be perceived. (That is not really a complaint since _KOTOR_ is what eventually lead to _Mass Effect_.) My single _Torment_ playthrough was plagued by my wrong decision to play as a mage which made goings-on mindnumbingly difficult towards the end, not to mention it too was as buggy as _KOTOR_. No complaints can be made of _Half Life's_ polish, but the caveat with _HL_ is that it is a linear storyline, not an RPG.

When I first played through _Mass Effect_ in 2007, I was left speechless. I had enjoyed all of the aforementioned games, but none of them had given me that special feeling, that sheer exhilaration which _ME_ gave me when I completed it the first time around. That first time when I realized the scale of _ME's_ storyline and what the creators had planned over the course of the trilogy is something I will never forget. But that is a discussion for another place and another time. I'll discuss the nitty-gritties of the plot during the course of the subsequent posts.

Ultimately, _Mass Effect_ remains such a great experience because despite telling a scripted story that some writers cooked up at Bioware, every single person who played the game felt as if he was telling his own story. It is probably the only game where no two players would've had the same experience. That is what caused the uproar at the trilogy's conclusion because having three predetermined endings wasn't as personal as having an ending where you, the player, actually mattered. The entire journey had been really personal, while the ending was decidedly not.

As for me, the depth to which I got attached to my playthrough of the trilogy can be highlighted by saying that, right now, I associate _Mass Effect_ with the story of Commander Wayne Shepard. Just like _Lord of the Rings_ is the story of Gandalf/Aragorn/Frodo/Sam; like _Harry Potter_ is the story of Dumbledore/Voldemort/Potter/Ron/Hermione; like _Star Wars_ is the story of Anakin/Luke/Emperor/Obi-Wan, _Mass Effect_ to me is about Wayne Shepard/Ashley Williams/Captain Anderson and the wonderful assortment of supporting characters. I don't think I will be able to play as any other character for the foreseeable future, if ever. I am in my third playthrough of _Mass Effect_ right now, and I am planning to play through exactly the same way I did the first time around. That is what makes _Mass Effect_ a resplendent journey for me. It is like re-watching a great film or re-reading a great book, I want to relive Wayne Shepard's story and all the beautiful memories I have of my experience.

With that out of the way, I am planning for this to be a series of posts as I play through the three games. I am not making any promises, but I took up to playing _Mass Effect_ recently because I've been going through a tough phase in my life and wanted to be reminded of what it is to have fun again. I will be talking about everything _Mass Effect_, from gameplay to characters and plot to races and politics. They will all be distilled through my personal experiences of the game.
