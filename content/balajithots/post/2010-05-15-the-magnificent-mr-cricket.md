Michael Hussey takes Australia to the World T20 Championship Final[/caption] When somebody, somewhere in the world of cricket decided to bestow a cricketer with the nickname of Mr. Cricket, they would have probably looked at all the possible candidates deserving of such a title in the modern game. On the one hand, you had Sachin Tendulkar who, in most Indians’ minds anyways, would probably be the only person worthy of such high praise. After all, he is the holder of almost all individual records in both ODIs and Tests and has been around the game long enough that the tag of Mr. Cricket would not be too misfit when attached to him. On the other hand, you also had Ricky Ponting, who has been the best and most consistent player of the past decade and has led the Aussies to two consecutive world cup triumphs. And, although I have stated two of the most obvious candidates, you also had a host of other candidates, who I am probably missing. The fact that when there were such elite players ahead of him, this very special nickname has gone to Michael Hussey itself should be proof enough of the man’s greatness.

Of course, all of the above is purely assumption. It’s not like someone actually sat down and looked at a list of candidates to be called Mr. Cricket and then decided on Hussey. I was more or less trying to lend a bit of perspective that when such players who have been associated with tags like “being the greatest ever” and more were present, why have we come to so fondly call Michael Hussey with what is probably a titular nickname for the sport in general. Yet, in hindsight, he is probably the only person deserving of such a title. And, as if to justify that point further (as if his ODI and Test innings are not justifications enough), he has gone and played what will be recognized as one of the greatest T20 innings in years to come against Pakistan in the World Cup T20 semi-final yesterday.

When Michael Hussey walked in to the crease yesterday, he would’ve found himself in an all-too-familiar position of having to salvage the match and finish the innings for his country. The Aussies had just lost Michael’s brother, David Hussey, and were struggling at 105-5 with Hussey and Cameron White the last recognized batting pair; and still requiring 87 from 44 balls to reach the final of the World T20 Championship for the first time in their history. As he always does, he started off in a more subdued manner, letting White have more of the strike since the latter had been in longer and was also a better hitter than himself. It seemed to go on well enough, but then White was dismissed for 43 and Australia fell to 139-6 in the 17th over, and it looked like all but over for them. They still required 53 from 21 balls, a feat that is an unlikely possibility even with two recognized hitters, but when you combine a stroke player (a la Hussey) and a few tailenders, then the equation really moves further away from you.

The biggest mistake Pakistan made yesterday, and one you should never make when a player of such outstanding quality as Hussey is still around, is fall into the trap of thinking the match is won. Pakistan’s bowling and fielding really faltered in the final few overs and it was all Hussey needed to clinch it for the Aussies. Even with Pakistan’s performance dropping, the equation was still highly against Australia and Hussey is probably the one of the few people, Michael Bevan obviously comes to mind as the other, who could have pulled off such a victory with a tailender at the other end. To put a bit of spin on things, here’s how the final 3 overs of the match transpired. (Stats thanks to Cricinfo)

The penultimate over of the match displayed above is a masterclass in limited overs batting by Mr. Cricket. Australia were in such a situation where lesser cricketers would have thought that a boundary was required off every ball, panicked and tried to slog each ball eventually getting out in the process. If ever there was a lesson required on how to effectively finish a limited overs innings, the above table depicts it perfectly. 16 runs off the over with no sixes, no slogs and no pinch-hits – just solid, masterful stroke-play and effective running between the wickets. Of course, the 20th over was an ever more difficult feat to achieve, so it’s wise to display that too. **20th over**

The most important thing to be noted from the above table is Johnson’s solitary run off the first ball. In a situation where most tailenders (though calling Johnson as such is probably doing him a great shame) would have tried to slog and hog all the glory, Johnson coolly took a single and handed the strike back to the better player. The action that followed cannot be explained in mere words, but suffice it to say that it will be considered as one of the best-ever finishes to a T20 game. It would be simple enough to point out that Michael Hussey was still panting out of the adrenaline rush when he came up to collect his man of the match award, and that would be enough to highlight the greatness of the innings and the match. To add a sense of perspective to it, when somebody of the calibre of Michael Hussey says that this could be his greatest innings ever, then you have to lift your head up and notice, because the man has literally finished off tens of hundreds of matches for his team.

Coming back to the topic on hand, such cricketing talent outlined by this innings is possibly not enough for a person to be called Mr. Cricket. However, Hussey is also an astute reader of the game as his performances in different playing, mental, and physical conditions have proved. And, more than that, he is a proper gentleman in every sense of the word, as his interviews have displayed time-and-again. All of that is secondary, of course; it all comes down to a simple fact: Michael Hussey is quite simply the only cricketer in the modern game who justifies the nickname of Mr. Cricket. Innings like the one he played yesterday only serve to highlight what the world of cricket had been missing before his eventual entry into the game at the less-than-modest age of 30 (Thanks largely to Australia’s selection policies, but that’s a whole different topic).

It would be ideal to end with something along the lines of, “Long Live the Genius”, but that just sounds cheesy and brings Hussey’s level down. So, here’s hoping to more match-winning performances from the gentleman we all love to call Mr. Cricket.
