**[Geek Night Chennai - 56th
Edition](https://twchennai.github.io/geeknight/)**: An introductory
talk to the Rust Programming Language. The goal of this talk was to
highlight some of the challenges faced by web/application programmers
in transitioning to systems programming using C/C++, and how Rust
helps us overcome them with its design.
