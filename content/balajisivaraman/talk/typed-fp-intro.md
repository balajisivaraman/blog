**[TW Chennai
Workshop](https://www.facebook.com/groups/chennaigeeks/permalink/1223952370963133/)**:
This was a half-day workshop that I conducted with my colleague in
ThoughtWorks Chennai. It first began with an introduction to typed FP
using the List algebraic data type. It then presents the [Tic Tac
Toe](https://github.com/tonymorris/fp-course/blob/master/projects/TicTacToe/TicTacToe.markdown)
problem statement devised by Tony Morris and demonstrates how to
approach solving it in Scala.
